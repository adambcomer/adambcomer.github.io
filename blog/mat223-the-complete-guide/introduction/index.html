        <h1>MAT223: Introduction</h1>
        <h6>Adam Comer | 11/26/18 | Read time: 5 min 13 sec</h6>
        <p>Before diving into any new study, a foundational vocabulary must be established to facilitate a discussion
            among the people who study or work in that area. Once we develop this vocabulary, we can build the concepts
            and theorems in MAT223 out of this foundational vocabulary. This section of the guide will be about sets,
            set notation, set operations, and set building. To anyone one who is familiar with set notation and logic,
            I recommend skimming to find any unfamiliar concepts and reviewing those. </p>

        <h2>Sets:</h2>
        <p>A <a class="definition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a> is a collection of
            unique objects. This collection can be of finite or infinite length. Each object in a
            set is called an <a class="definition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics)">element</a>.
            For example, we could imagine a set of things in my backpack; this would include
            my laptop, a planner, a pen, and a phone charger. This set would look like this.</p>

        <p>$$Backpack = \{laptop, planer, phone\,charger\}$$</p>

        <p>Using brackets, this is the simplest way we can define the set of things in my backpack. In this example,
            each item in my backpack is an element of the set. Now, what if I add another pen to my backpack. Under the
            definition of a set, the set Backpack wouldn’t change as there is already a pen in the set. Now if I add a
            water bottle to my backpack, this will change the set to include a water bottle. This example is supposed
            to give you an intuitive understanding of a set before we start working with sets of numbers.</p>

        <p>Just like we can have a set of things in my backpack we can have a set of numbers. Before we start creating
            our own numerical sets. There are a few basic sets that we must learn first. Here they are,</p>
        <div>
            <p><span class="special-sets">$\mathbb{N}$</span> - Set of Natural Numbers. The natural numbers are also
                known as the counting numbers. This set
                looks like $\{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}.$</p>
            <p><span class="special-sets">$\mathbb{Z}$</span> - Set of Integers. The set of integers are similar to
                natural numbers but includes negative
                numbers. This set looks like $\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}.$</p>
            <p><span class="special-sets">$\mathbb{Q}$</span> - Set of Rational numbers. The set of rational numbers is
                the set of all fractions of
                integers. This set would include numbers like $7/12, 8/5, -40/9$ as well as all of the integers.</p>
            <p><span class="special-sets">$\mathbb{R}$</span> - Set of Real Numbers. The set of real numbers is the set
                of all irrational numbers(numbers
                like $\pi$ and $e$) and all rational numbers(fractions). The set is all of the numbers on a number
                line.</p><br>
        </div>

        <p>These four sets are needed to produce the definitions and theorems in MAT223 and are the only ones you have
            to memorize as they come up often.</p>


        <h2>Set Comparisons:</h2>
        <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of sets and can identify a few, we can start to apply comparisons on
            sets. First, we need to be able to check if an element is in a set. Using the first example, we need a way
            to say that a pen is in my backpack and an elephant is not in my backpack. Using notation, this is written
            as,</p>

        <p>$$pen \in Backpack$$</p>
        <p>$$elephant \notin Backpack$$</p>

        <p>The curvy E is used to say that the pen is in Backpack and the E with a slash is used to say that the
            Elephant is not in Backpack. This E is read as “____ is an element of ____” and the E with a slash is read
            as “____ is not an element of ____.”</p>

        <p>The next comparison operator to look at is the subset. Sometimes we may need to determine if all of the
            elements in one set are in another set. To better visualize this we will use this Venn diagram.</p>

        <img id="sets-one-img" src="/assets/blog/mat223-the-complete-guide/sets-one.svg">

        <p>In this Venn diagram, we can see that the set B is inside of the set A, in other words, all of the elements
            in set B are in set A. If we took every element in B and checked if it was in A, they would all pass this
            test. Thus we can say that the set B is a subset of set A. Using notation we can write this as.</p>

        <p>$$B \subseteq A$$</p>

        <p>The last comparison operator is to check if two sets are equal to each other. Equality of sets is when the
            first set is a subset of the second and the second set is a subset of the first. In other words, this would
            mean that the elements in both sets are the same, thus creating equality. Using two sets A and B we can say
            they are equal if.</p>

        <div class="test-definition">
            <div><i>Test Definition</i></div>
            <p>$$A \subseteq B\,\,and\,\,B \subseteq A$$</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Set Building:</h2>
        <p>The most challenging part of the foundation material is set building. When sets can be very large or in some
            cases infinitely long we can’t write them using the bracket notation. To express a set with infinite
            elements, we need to tell the reader how to construct the set. This idea is called set building, and it
            comes along with notation called set builder notation. To start, I will show a simple example. Let's say I
            want to get all of the natural numbers greater than 5. Since this set is of infinite size, I can’t write
            every element of this set. Thus we need to build a set from the natural numbers such that all elements are
            greater than 5. We would write this as,</p>

        <p>$$X = \{x \in \mathbb{N} : x > 5\}$$</p>

        <p>Let's start by walking through this example. This set is read as “for all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural
            number and greater than 5”. To build this set, we would take all natural numbers and check if they pass the
            condition $x \gt 5$ and if it passes the test, then it is in the set. For example, let's take the natural
            number 1. Since $1 \lt 5$ we can say 1 is not in the set $X$. Another example would be set $x$ to 10. Since
            $10 \gt 5$ we can say that 10 is in the set $X$.</p>

        <p>You can see that using set builder notation we can create subsets of sets reasonably easily. For example,
            the definition of a subset in the course is defined using set builder notation.</p>

        <div class="test-definition">
            <div><i>Test Definition</i></div>
            <p>$$Y = \{x \in X : some\,restriction\,on\,x\} \\
                or \\
                Y = \{\forall x \in X, some\,restriction\,on\,x\}$$</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Set Operations:</h2>
        <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of sets and can identify a few, we can start to apply operations on
            sets. First, we want to perform operations on sets using other sets, not just individual elements. Let's
            start with the scenario that we might have two sets and want to combine them. This merging of two sets is
            called a union of two sets. To best understand a union of two sets I recommend looking at a Vein diagram of
            two sets.</p>

        <img id="sets-two-img" src="/assets/blog/mat223-the-complete-guide/sets-two.svg">

        <p>If we want to take the union of these sets we will create a new set, call this set C. This set C consists of
            the elements in the green area(in set A, but not set B), blue area(in set B, but not set A), and orange
            area(in set A and in set B). Using mathematical notation we can write this operation as.</p>

        <div class="test-definition">
            <div><i>Test Definition</i></div>
            <p>$$\begin{align}
                C &= A \cup B \\
                &= \{x : x \in A\,\,or\,\,x \in B\}
                \end{align}$$</p>
        </div>

        <p>The second operation to look at is an intersection of two sets. The intersection of two sets is a set of
            elements that are in both sets. Using the Vien diagram from above, we can produce a set of elements that
            are only in A and B and will create a new set. We will call this D. The set D will consist of all the
            elements in the orange area (in set A and in set B). Using mathematical notation we can write this
            operation as.</p>

        <div class="test-definition">
            <div><i>Test Definition</i></div>
            <p>$$\begin{align}
                D &= A \cap B \\
                &= \{x : x \in A\,\,and\,\,x \in B\}
                \end{align}$$</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Sets and set notation is often the foundational material of many mathematics courses at the University of
            Toronto. Having a strong understanding of the four main sets and set builder notation will be very helpful
            in later lectures and courses. Most if not all of the concepts and definitions in this article will show up
            in every lecture during the semester.</p>
