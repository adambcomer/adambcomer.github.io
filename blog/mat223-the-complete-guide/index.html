        <p>As a student at the University of Toronto(UofT) who takes a lot of math, statistics, and computer science
            courses, I always wished there were guides published online by students who took the class. So instead of
            waiting until I graduate until one comes out, I decided to create my own for all future students who take
            MAT223: Linear Algebra. I hope this proves to be helpful in your studies and if there is anything that
            could be done to make it better please don’t be afraid to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>

        <p>In this guide, I will do my best to try to organize the content, explain topics, and provide relevant links
            if I feel I can’t adequately convey a topic. As well I will highlight definitions that are expected to be
            known for the test. The first article will be about some of the foundational knowledge but contains
            definitions so don’t skip it.</p>
        <h4>This is a work in progress</h4>

        <h2>Table of Contents:</h2>
        <ol id="table-of-contents">
            <li><a href="./introduction/">Introduction</a></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>FAQ:</h2>
        <h4>Why are you working on this?</h4>
        <p>Good question! As a student, I have to study for this course and sink a lot of time into it. On top of that,
            one of the most effective ways to study is to teach a concept to another person. The second reason is I
            would like to help my peers better understand the course material. I've found that I waste a lot of time
            trying to understand vague concepts from lecture and tutorial. Collectively we all waste even more time,
            and if I can save someone who struggles like me a bit of time, it's worth it. The final reason is it adds
            content to my website which I hear employers like when you can show that you can build something. Overall I
            have to study so why not help others and build my resume in one go.</p>
